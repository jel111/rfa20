          <p>Real world application drives 21st Century, academic learning. In this generation, students don’t learn to do they do to learn. They live in a fast-paced society and are impatient with the slow and steady rhythm of the traditional classroom. How do significant curriculum shifts toward a more relevant, rigorous, inquiry-oriented approach occur within this assessment-driven culture? How do teachers guide kids to dig into authentic problems? How do they support “high-tech” applications in a digital-rich classroom? How do they foster collegial, “high-touch” teamwork on projects and papers? How do they challenge students with rigor in “high-thought” explorations, investigations, and experimentations? “The times, they are a changing”, and they are changing at breakneck speed. How do we, as leaders, retool schools to meet the challenges in relevant ways?</p>

          <p>It's time to transform instruction with enriched Problem-based Learning in a Nutshell
            Here is the big secret about PBL . . . It’s not that complicated! Moving toward relevance
            in the curriculum that uses 21st Century, real-world applications, student inquiry models
            are front and center-problem-based, project, and service learning experiences are among
            the most frequently cited. It’s efffective to get started with tools already familiar to
            teachers today: graphic organizers, essential questions, rich and relevant content,
            rigorous thinking skills, digital-rich tools for searching and researching, collaborative
            team work and presentation skills. Simply put: PBL is like DIY (Do It Yourself) projects-
            Do It-to-Learn-It, 21st Century methodology, rather, than Learn It-to-Do-It, 20th
            Century traditions.</p>
          <ul>
            Objectives and Outcomes:
            <li>Develop Question-Collect, Reflect, Select</li>

            <li>Organize Information-Notes, Graphics, Outline</li>
            <li>Create Evidence-Project, Problem-based, Service Learning</li>
            <li>Present Findings-Product, Presentation, Performance</li>

          <p>Using the Three Story Intellect to assure teachers that students are moving through the three levels of thinking-gathering, processing and applying, students learn to think more deeply. As they become more aware of their thinking, confidence increases dramatically, and the shift from the teacher-directed classroom environment to a student-centered culture of respect, responsibility and reliability is the ultimate goal. Learn how to teach kids to think, critically and creatively. Help students begin earlier, rather than later, to adapt self-dispositions of mindfulness that prepare them for test of life. Grounded in 21st Century thinking processes: productive problem solving, mindful decision-making and creative innovation, students develop awareness and control of their own actions, words and deeds. (Can substitute DOK’s or Bloom’s Taxonomy to align to district). </p>

          <a href="images/pdf/RFAPDWhosDoingtheTalking.pdf" class="button small icon fa-download">PDF</a> <img class="image fit" src="images/Workshop/WhoTalkingColor.jpg" alt="">
          <p>As part of the compendium of best practices, the idea that the person doing the talking is the person doing the learning seems counter-intuitive. Yet, that is exactly the case. When students are required to put their thoughts into words, to
            communicate their ideas to someone else, they are actually internalizing the learning as they struggle to make their emerging thoughts clear. The question, "Who's doing the talking?” is a gentle reminder that students must be actively involved and mindfully engaged in the learning experience for authentic learning to occur. They must dialogue with peers, articulate their ideas in small groups and express themselves clearly in front of the entire class. In turn, these oral language skills translate directly into written language skills.</p>
