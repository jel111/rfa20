          <h4 class="center">Are You Ready to Be Great?</h4>
          <p>Robin Fogarty and Associates Present</p>
          <p>The target goals of the RFA Conference, Leading Schools on the Brink of Greatness, are focused on supporting leaders, teachers and students, also on the brink of greatness, in the transformation of their schools. Think about this, all stakeholders have been working hard and working smart since the Common Core State Standards began. We are doing a good job. It’s getting better.</p>
          <p>Leaders executed the framework that put the Common Core in place. Teachers implemented the new national standards through collegial conversations, collaborations and eventually with celebrations. Students did their part, too, by striving earnestly to achieve the rigor required to raise the bar on assignments, achievement and of course, on the assessments. </p>
          <p>Now, it’s time to move forward, again. Register for this unique Think Tank in July 2017 in the Greatest City in America!. Experience what happens when your entire leadership team synchronizes their efforts across the school with this elegant and achievable mission: moving your school for good to great. </p>
