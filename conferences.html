									<h3>Schools on the Brink of Greatness</h3>
									<h4>From Staffroom to Classroom</h4>
									<p>Robin Fogarty and Associates Present</p>
									<p>The target goals of the RFA Conference, Schools on the Brink of Greatness, are focused on supporting leaders, teachers and students, also on the brink of greatness, in the transformation of their schools. Think about this, all stakeholders have been working hard and working smart since the Common Core State Standards were introduced. We are doing a good job. It’s getting better.</p>
										<p>Leaders executed the framework that put the Common Core in place. Teachers implemented the new national standards through collegial conversations, collaborations and eventually with celebrations. Students did their part, too, by striving earnestly to achieve the rigor required to raise the bar on assignments, achievement and of course, on the assessments. </p>
						  <p>Now, it’s time to move forward, again. Register for this unique Think Tank in February 2017 in the Land of Enchantment, Santa Fe New Mexico. Experience what happens when your entire leadership team synchronizes their efforts across the school with this elegant and achievable mission: moving your school from good to great. Believe it! You are on the Brink of Greatness!</p>
										<p><em>Some words from a past participant:</em></p>
										<p><blockquote>In our most recent staff development survey, our teachers have indicated the highest level of transfer ever recorded!  Nearly 89% responded that they have integrated 5 or more strategies per SD day this year!  (We have a 100% response rate, btw…).  Unreal!</blockquote></p> 
										<p><blockquote>“The Staff Room to Classroom Conference was the catalyst that has lead to district-wide professional development reform.  Collaboratively using From Staffroom to Classroom as our guide, we continue to provide teachers with meaningful and transferrable instructional best practices.  We are seeing the transfer in observations and walk-throughs daily!”</blockquote></p>
											<p class="wsListTop">Happy holidays and thanks for your inspiration!<br>
											Tony Brazouski, Ph.D.<br>
											Executive Director of Academic Achievement</p>

												<li><strong><bold>DESIGN</bold></strong> professional development experiences that are systemic, practical, job-embedded and sustained over time, to foster immediate take-aways.</li>
												<li><strong><bold>EMBRACE</bold></strong> the best practices in professional development and essential elements of Joyce and Shower’s proven training model.</li>
												<li><strong><bold>PRACTICE</bold></strong> the presentation skills of sage on the stage, the facilitation skills of guide on the side, as well as the mediation skills of the coach in the field.</li>
